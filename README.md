## Web Interface with Angular

Created an interface with angular in order to make appointments for a pet doctor.
There is a form that lets people add appointments, read a list of the appointments from a file, and delete, modify search those appointments.

- Run npm install to install the project dependencies
- Run ng serve to start live preview server
